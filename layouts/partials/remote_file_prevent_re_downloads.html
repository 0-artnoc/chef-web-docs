<p>To prevent Chef Infra Client from re-downloading files that are already present on a node, use one of the following attributes in a recipe: <code>use_conditional_get</code> (default) or <code>checksum</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>use_conditional_get</code> attribute is the default behavior of Chef Infra Client. If the remote file is located on a server that supports ETag and/or If-Modified-Since headers, Chef Infra Client will use a conditional <code>GET</code> to determine if the file has been updated. If the file has been updated, Chef Infra Client will re-download the file.</li>
<li>The <code>checksum</code> attribute will ask Chef Infra Client to compare the checksum for the local file to the one at the remote location. If they match, Chef Infra Client will not re-download the file. Using a local checksum for comparison requires that the local checksum be the correct checksum.</li>
</ul>
<p>The desired approach just depends on the desired workflow. For example, if a node requires a new file every day, using the checksum approach would require that the local checksum be updated and/or verified every day as well, in order to ensure that the local checksum was the correct one. Using a conditional <code>GET</code> in this scenario will greatly simplify the management required to ensure files are being updated accurately.</p>
