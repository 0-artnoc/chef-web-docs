<p>Chef Infra Client processes recipes in two phases:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, each resource in the node object is identified and a resource collection is built. All recipes are loaded in a specific order, and then the actions specified within each of them are identified. This is also referred to as the "compile phase".</li>
<li>Next, Chef Infra Client configures the system based on the order of the resources in the resource collection. Each resource then examines the node and performs the necessary steps to complete the action. This is also referred to as the "execution phase".</li>
</ol>
<p>Typically, actions are processed during the execution phase of a Chef Infra Client run. However, sometimes it is necessary to run an action during the compile phase. For example, a resource can be configured to install a package during the compile phase to ensure that application is available to other resources during the execution phase.</p>
