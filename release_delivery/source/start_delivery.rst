Welcome to Chef Delivery
=====================================================

|delivery| manages changes to both infrastructure and application code, giving your development and operations teams a common platform for developing, testing, and deploying cookbooks, building applications, releasing source code to a repository such as |github|, and more.

|delivery| accelerates the adoption of continuous delivery and encourages collaboration. It provides a proven, reproducible workflow for managing changes as they flow through the pipeline from a local workstation, through automated tests, and out into production servers in real time.
