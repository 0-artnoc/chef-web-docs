A project may be a binary, a package, or some other set of arbitrary information. The |delivery| pipeline supports promoting projects through the pipeline using versioned attributes. This is known as a project application. A project application is a useful way to promote projects by using a set of attributes that are pinned to a specific version, and then using those same versioned attributes when deploying software to various stages in the |delivery| pipeline.
