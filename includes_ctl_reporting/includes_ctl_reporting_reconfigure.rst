The ``reconfigure`` subcommand is used when changes are made to the |chef server| configuration file to reconfigure the server. When changes are made to the |chef server| configuration file, they will not be applied to the |chef server| configuration until after this command is run. 

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ opscode-reporting-ctl reconfigure
