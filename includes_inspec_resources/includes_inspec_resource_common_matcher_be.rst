Use the ``be`` matcher to use a comparison operator---``=`` (equal to), ``>`` (greater than), ``<`` (less than), ``>=`` (greater than or equal to), and ``<=`` (less than or equal to)---to compare two values: ``its('value') { should be >= value }``, ``its('value') { should be < value }``, and so on.
