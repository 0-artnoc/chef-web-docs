|grub| is a boot loader on the |linux| platform used to load and then transfer control to an operating system kernel, after which that kernel initializes the rest of the operating system. Use the ``grub_conf`` |inspec resource| to test boot loader configuration settings that are defined in the ``grub.conf`` configuration file.
