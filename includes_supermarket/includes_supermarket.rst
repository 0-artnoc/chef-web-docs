|supermarket| is the site for community cookbooks. It provides an easily searchable cookbook repository, a friendly web UI, and the ``knife supermarket`` command-line interface. Cookbooks that are part of the |supermarket| are accessible by any |chef| user.

There are two ways to use |supermarket|:

* The public |supermarket| is hosted by |company_name| and is located at |url supermarket|. Contributing to cookbooks on |supermarket| :doc:`requires signing a license </community_contributions>`.
* A private |supermarket| may be installed on-premise behind the firewall on the internal network. Cookbook retrieval from a private |supermarket| is often faster than from the public |supermarket| because of closer proximity and fewer cookbooks to resolve. A private cookbook can also help formalize internal cookbook release management processes (e.g. "a cookbook is not released until it's published on |supermarket|").
