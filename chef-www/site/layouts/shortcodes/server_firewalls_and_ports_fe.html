For front-end servers, ensure that ports marked as external (marked as
`yes` in the **External** column) are open and accessible via any
firewalls that are in use:

The **nginx** service is used to manage traffic to the Chef Infra
Server, including virtual hosts for internal and external API
request/response routing, external add-on request routing, and routing

The **oc-id** service enables OAuth 2.0 authentication to the Chef Infra
Server by external applications, including Chef Supermarket. OAuth 2.0
uses token-based authentication, where external applications use tokens
that are issued by the **oc-id** provider. No special
credentials---`webui_priv.pem` or privileged keys---are stored on the
external application.
