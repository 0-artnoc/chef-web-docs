<p>When using an explicit <code>gem_binary</code>, options must be passed as a string. When not using an explicit <code>gem_binary</code>, Chef Infra Client is forced to spawn a gems process to install the gems (which uses more system resources) when options are passed as a string. String options are passed verbatim to the gems command and should be specified just as if they were passed on a command line. For example, <code>--prerelease</code> for a pre-release gem.</p>
