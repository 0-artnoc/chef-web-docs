<p>A resource may notify another resource to take action when its state changes. Specify a <code>'resource[name]'</code>, the <code>:action</code> that resource should take, and then the <code>:timer</code> for that action. A resource may notify more than one resource; use a <code>notifies</code> statement for each resource to be notified.</p>
