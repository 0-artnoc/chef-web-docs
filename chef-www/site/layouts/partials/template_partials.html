<p>A template can be built in a way that allows it to contain references to one (or more) smaller template files. (These smaller template files are also referred to as partials.) A partial can be referenced from a template file in one of the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>By using the <code>render</code> method in the template file</li>
<li>By using the <strong>template</strong> resource and the <code>variables</code> property.</li>
</ul>
