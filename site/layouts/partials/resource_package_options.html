<p>The RubyGems package provider attempts to use the RubyGems API to install gems without spawning a new process, whenever possible. A gems command to install will be spawned under the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a <code>gem_binary</code> property is specified (as a hash, a string, or by a .gemrc file), Chef Infra Client will run that command to examine its environment settings and then again to install the gem.</li>
<li>When install options are specified as a string, Chef Infra Client will span a gems command with those options when installing the gem.</li>
<li>The Chef installer will search the <code>PATH</code> for a gem command rather than defaulting to the current gem environment. As part of <code>enforce_path_sanity</code>, the <code>bin</code> directories area added to the <code>PATH</code>, which means when there are no other proceeding RubyGems, the installation will still be operated against it.</li>
</ul>
