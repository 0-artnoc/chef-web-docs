Starting with |reporting| 1.6.0, the `Chef MLSA <https://docs.chef.io/chef_license.html>`__ must be accepted when reconfiguring the product. If the |chef license| has not already been accepted, the reconfigure process will prompt for a ``yes`` to accept it. Or run ``opscode-reporting-ctl reconfigure --accept-license`` to automatically accept the license.
