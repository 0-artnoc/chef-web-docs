All |chef| products have a master license that governs the entire product and includes links to license files for any third-party software included in |chef| packages. The ``/opt/<PRODUCT-NAME>/LICENSES`` directory contains individual copies of all licenses referenced by the master license.

* For open source products---such as the |chef client|, the |chef server|, or |inspec|---a copy of the master license is provided as part of the package.
* For closed source products---such as |chef compliance|, |chef analytics|, |reporting|, and |manage|---upgrading to a version that includes the master license will require accepting it as part of reconfiguring that product during the upgrade process.
