If a project is a cookbook, we recommend starting with ``delivery-truck``, an open source build cookbook created for driving cookbook pipelines in |delivery|. You can customize some aspects of ``delivery-truck`` through your project's ``.delivery/config.json``. To have more control or to opt-out of some of the behavior of ``delivery-truck``, create a wrapper build cookbook.
